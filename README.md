Chrome2Markdown
===

My first gem. This tool accepts exported Google Chrome bookmark files, and a bookmark folder name and creates a markdown formatted array of links.

I wanted to make it for quickly updating my ['Essentials' list](https://parodybit.net/blog/2013/08/23/essentials/) and noticed that it couldbe adaptable to any folder on any system.
